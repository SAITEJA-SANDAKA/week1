# Week-1
Predicting Solar Power Output Using Linear Regression

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the power output of solar panels based on environmental factors using linear regression. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies patterns and relationships between variables like sunlight intensity, temperature, and humidity to estimate solar power generation.

Objectives

Build a predictive model to estimate solar power output.

Understand the impact of environmental factors on solar panel performance.

Evaluate the accuracy of the linear regression model.

Dataset

The dataset includes historical data on solar power output and related environmental factors:

Solar Radiation (kW/m²): Measure of sunlight intensity.

Temperature (°C): Ambient temperature.

Humidity (%): Atmospheric moisture.

Power Output (kW): Power generated by the solar panels.

Ensure the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before model training to handle missing or inconsistent data.

Methodology

Data Collection:

Gather historical data on solar power output and environmental factors.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Normalize/standardize features for better model performance.

Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Implement a linear regression model using libraries like Python’s scikit-learn.

Train the model on the training data.

Evaluation:

Assess the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared value.

Validate the model’s predictions against the test data.

Tools and Libraries

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical computations

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

scikit-learn for building and evaluating the regression model

Results

The linear regression model is expected to provide insights into how environmental factors influence solar power output.

Model accuracy and error metrics will be reported to evaluate its reliability
